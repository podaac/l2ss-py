## How to Get Help

The easiest way to get help or ask a question regarding L2SS-Py is in 
the EOSDIS Slack #harmony-l2-subsetter channel, or by asking a question 
on the [PO.DAAC Forum](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/forum/viewforum.php?f=6).

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Bugs can be reported by creating a new Github issue in this repository. 
Please use the `bug` label on any bug issue created. Provide detailed 
instructions on how to reproduce the bug if possible. Include the version 
of L2SS-Py that produced this bug and specific error messages.

### Feature/Enhancement Requests

Feature/enhancement requests are tracked with Github issues. Please use 
an appropriate label:

- `documentation`
    - Docstring or sphinx documentation changes
- `automation`
    - Anything related to CI/CD or metadata
- `enhancement`
    - Improvement of an existing feature
- `new-feature`
    - An entirely new feature
    
Feature and enhancement requests should contain a detailed description 
of the desired behavior and rationale.

### Pull Requests

Please ensure all pull requests follow the PR 
[template](/.github/pull_request_template.md). This is to ensure

* A reviewer understands what is being changed
* A reviewer understands why it is being changed
* A reviewer understands how the changes have been verified
* A reviewer is confident the changes work as expected and won't break existing functionality.

The name of the pull request should be meaningful, and if the pull 
request is addressing a Github issue, should match the name of the 
Github issue. 

If any performance improvements are being made, include graphs and charts.

### Branches

- `develop` (protected)
    - Code actively being developed
- `main` (protected)
    - Matches the version currently in prod
- `release/#.#.#`
    - Release branch being considered for delivery to prod. 
    - Matches the version currently in test
- `feature/issue-#`
    - Work for enhancements and new features should be done in a branch with this naming convention
    - The issue number should match the associated Github issue number
- `bugfix/issue-#`
    - Work for bug fixes should be done in a branch with this naming convention
    - The issue number should match the associated Github issue number
- `hotfix/issue-#` or `hotfix/short-fix-description`
    - Rare/special case to address a special anomaly.
    - The issue number should match the associated Github issue number, 
    unless no such issue exists. If not, use a short description of the 
    issue e.g. `hotfix/fix-request-url`

### Changelog

L2SS-Py maintains a [changelog](CHANGELOG.md). See 
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) for more 
information.

The top of the changelog will contain an `[Unreleased]` section. Add 
any changes made in the current PR to the appropriate section of the 
changelog.

Please keep changelog messages relatively short (1-2 sentences).

### Testing

In almost all cases unit tests should be either created or updated in every PR.

Every Python module contains an associated test file named 
`test_nameofmodule.py`. If resources are needed for unit tests, they 
should be placed in `tests/data`. Test coverage reports are generated 
as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

If a change impacts the harmony adapter code, the code should be tested 
with Harmony. There are instructions 
[here](https://github.com/nasa/harmony#Quick-Start) on deploying a local 
instance of Harmony.

### Reviewing

Another valuable way to contribute to the project is to review pull 
requests. Pull requests reviews are appreciated and valued by anybody 
at any skill level.

#### Review responsibilities

This list is intended for people conducting code reviews of pull 
requests. When reviewing a pull request the reviewer should use the 
following checklist to verify that the code will not break clients or 
cause problems and that the code/tests are correct, complete, follow 
conventions/guidelines, and can be merged into the master branch without 
issue. Some of the items on the list are very specific, e.g., no TODOs, 
while others are more open ended (well structured tests). The list is 
intended to make the job of reviewing pull requests easier and more 
repeatable by identifying areas in pull requests that commonly need 
addressing. 

When reviewing a pull request, start at the top of the list and consider 
the most important things that could lead to problems. These are 
outlined as a set of questions in the Most Important section. Check off 
the boxes when you are satisfied that each of the criteria is met. Then 
proceed to the more specific items below in the General, Testing, and 
Documentation sections.  Check off each box that is satisfied by the 
pull request and add comments to the pull request for those that are 
not. If all the boxes are checked then approve the request. Otherwise, 
mark it as needing work, or, if there are critical errors, decline it.

#### Most Important (Primum non nocere - "First, do no harm")

- Could this change break clients?
- Do the changes handle data that may have been previously saved or 
indexed by an older version of the code?
- What is the operational impact of this change - are there any 
potential issues such as special deployment procedures, performance 
issues, etc.?
- Are there tests for all cases (including edge cases)?
- What could go wrong?

#### General
- Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
- Have they implemented all of the acceptance criteria?
- There are no overly-long or complicated functions that should to be 
broken up for readability
- Are web API parameters validated?
- Are symbols used rather than “magic number” constants or string 
constants? (OK in tests, particularly for error messages or response codes)
- There is no repeated or copy-and-paste code / tests
- There are no TODOs
- There are no stray comment blocks, commented out code, capture/reveals, 
proto-saves, printlns, or unnecessary logging
- All namespaces and non-trivial defs/defns/defmacros have docstrings
- There are no dangling requires, i.e., requires that were added and 
not used or requires that are no longer necessary due to code removal
- Code conventions are followed

#### Testing
- If the issue is a bug fix - a test was added that reproduces the 
conditions that triggered the bug
- The tests are well structured and follow current practices

#### Documentation
- Documentation (api_docs.md, README.md, etc) was added for any new 
features or old documentation updated for any changed features
- Code/curl examples or sample data have been updated as necessary
- Has the CHANGELOG been updated?

## Style Guides

### Python Style Guide

L2SS-Py follows PEP8 as much as possible. Reference the [pylint](.pylintrc) and 
[flake8](.flake8) configuration files for specific expectations. The CI/CD pipeline 
will fail unless there are 0 flake8 warnings and anything other than a 
10/10 pylint score.

Please keep any Harmony or CMR-specific code out of the actual subset 
code. The subsetter should be able to run locally without any reliance 
on outside services.

### Documentation

L2SS-Py uses [Numpy docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html). 
All functions should contain a docstring, though short or trivial 
function may contain a 1-line docstring. 

If adding a new module, ensure it has been added to [index.rst](docs/index.rst) 
for inclusion in auto-generated Sphinx docs.
